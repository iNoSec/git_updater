 Usage: git_updater <directory>
    ex: git_updater /pentest/post-exploitation /pentest/exploitation /opt
        git_updater /pentest/*

First i made it for a training exercise of my (bad) bash scripting
I made it because i dont like the way the Pentest Framework of Trustedsec made the update of all tools. 

TODO list:

Prompt asking for what to do with the error: [K]eep local changes, [o]verwrite with update or [Q]uit i will decide later?
Clean up the code
